  "prompt": "A tiny round sky-blue songbird with a plump body, soft pale cream-colored belly, darker blue wingtips, a small tuft of feathers on its round head, a tiny pointed orange beak, and large expressive pitch-black oval eyes with two tiny white sparkle dots, — same sky-blue feathers, same cream belly, same orange beak — gliding smoothly with a large grin, wings held steady, flying between two large rounded white clouds in a bright blue sky, rendered entirely in cartoon style with clean 3px black outlines and a cheerful saturated palette. This is frame 10 of a continuous animated sequence.",
