  "prompt": "A tiny round sky-blue songbird with a plump body, soft pale cream-colored belly, darker blue wingtips, a small tuft of feathers on its round head, a tiny pointed orange beak, and large expressive pitch-black oval eyes with two tiny white sparkle dots, — same sky-blue feathers, same cream belly, same orange beak — flapping its wings downward with force, rising higher into the blue sky as the oak branch recedes to the bottom of the frame, rendered entirely in cartoon style with clean 3px black outlines and bright, simple colors. This is frame 8 of a continuous animated sequence.",
