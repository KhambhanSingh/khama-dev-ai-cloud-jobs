  "prompt": "A tiny round sky-blue songbird with a plump body, soft pale cream-colored belly, darker blue wingtips, a small tuft of feathers on its round head, a tiny pointed orange beak, and large expressive pitch-black oval eyes with two tiny white sparkle dots, — same sky-blue feathers, same cream belly, same orange beak — leaning its body backward away from the branch edge, a single sweat drop icon near its head, still on the same thick brown oak branch under a bright blue sky, rendered entirely in cartoon style with clean 3px black outlines, flat saturated colors, and squash-and-stretch proportions. This is frame 3 of a continuous animated sequence.",
