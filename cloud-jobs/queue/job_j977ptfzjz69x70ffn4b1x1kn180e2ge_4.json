  "prompt": "A tiny round sky-blue songbird with a plump body, soft pale cream-colored belly, darker blue wingtips, a small tuft of feathers on its round head, a tiny pointed orange beak, and large expressive pitch-black oval eyes with two tiny white sparkle dots, — same sky-blue feathers, same cream belly, same orange beak — turning its head 20 degrees to the right to see a larger identical blue bird's wing enter the frame, same thick brown oak branch environment, rendered entirely in cartoon style with clean 3px black outlines, bright primary colors, and simple background shapes. This is frame 4 of a continuous animated sequence.",
