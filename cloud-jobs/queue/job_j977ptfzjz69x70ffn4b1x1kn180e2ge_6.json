  "prompt": "A tiny round sky-blue songbird with a plump body, soft pale cream-colored belly, darker blue wingtips, a small tuft of feathers on its round head, a tiny pointed orange beak, and large expressive pitch-black oval eyes with two tiny white sparkle dots, — same sky-blue feathers, same cream belly, same orange beak — spreading its small wings outward by 30 degrees, crouching low on the same thick brown oak branch, muscles tensing for a jump, rendered entirely in cartoon style with clean 3px black outlines and bold saturated blue tones. This is frame 6 of a continuous animated sequence.",
