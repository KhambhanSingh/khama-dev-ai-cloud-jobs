  "prompt": "A tiny round sky-blue songbird with a plump body, soft pale cream-colored belly, darker blue wingtips, a small tuft of feathers on its round head, a tiny pointed orange beak, and large expressive pitch-black oval eyes with two tiny white sparkle dots, — same sky-blue feathers, same cream belly, same orange beak — soaring through the center of the frame, eyes closed in a happy squint, two fluffy white rounded clouds appearing in the background, rendered entirely in cartoon style with clean 3px black outlines and high-contrast primary colors. This is frame 9 of a continuous animated sequence.",
