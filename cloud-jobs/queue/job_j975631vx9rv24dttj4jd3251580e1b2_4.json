  "prompt": "Cartoon style emotional scene on a quiet hilltop after the leap. Maharana Pratap, with his recognizable armor and mustache, is standing next to Chetak, placing a hand gently on the horse's neck with an expression of deep gratitude and sorrow. The background shows the sun setting over the Aravalli hills, casting a golden glow. The atmosphere is solemn and legendary, maintaining the same color palette and artistic line work.",
