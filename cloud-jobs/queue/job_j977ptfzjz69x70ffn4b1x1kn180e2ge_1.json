  "prompt": "A tiny round sky-blue songbird with a plump body, soft pale cream-colored belly, darker blue wingtips, a small tuft of feathers on its round head, a tiny pointed orange beak, and large expressive pitch-black oval eyes with two tiny white sparkle dots, — same sky-blue feathers, same cream belly, same orange beak — standing still on a thick brown oak branch with three green leaves, looking nervously at the edge of the wood, rendered entirely in cartoon style with clean 3px black outlines, flat saturated colors, and minimal shading. This is frame 1 of a continuous animated sequence.",
