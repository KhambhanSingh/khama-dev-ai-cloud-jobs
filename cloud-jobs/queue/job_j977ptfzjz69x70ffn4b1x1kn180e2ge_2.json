  "prompt": "A tiny round sky-blue songbird with a plump body, soft pale cream-colored belly, darker blue wingtips, a small tuft of feathers on its round head, a tiny pointed orange beak, and large expressive pitch-black oval eyes with two tiny white sparkle dots, — same sky-blue feathers, same cream belly, same orange beak — vibrating slightly with a visible tremor, its tiny legs shaking while gripped to the same thick brown oak branch, eyes widening in fear, rendered entirely in cartoon style with clean 3px black outlines, flat saturated colors, and exaggerated expressions. This is frame 2 of a continuous animated sequence.",
