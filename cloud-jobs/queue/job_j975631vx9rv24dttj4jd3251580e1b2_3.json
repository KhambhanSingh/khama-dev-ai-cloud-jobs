  "prompt": "A dynamic cartoon style action shot of the white horse Chetak leaping across a wide, rocky mountain stream. Maharana Pratap is leaning forward, holding the reins tightly. Chetak has a visible wound on his hind leg but his expression is one of pure grit. Below them is a deep gorge with rushing water. The lighting is bright and heroic, emphasizing the incredible jump. The art style and character designs are perfectly consistent with the previous scenes.",
