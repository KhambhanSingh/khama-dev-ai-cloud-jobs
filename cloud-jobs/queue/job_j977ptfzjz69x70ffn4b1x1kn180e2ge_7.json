  "prompt": "A tiny round sky-blue songbird with a plump body, soft pale cream-colored belly, darker blue wingtips, a small tuft of feathers on its round head, a tiny pointed orange beak, and large expressive pitch-black oval eyes with two tiny white sparkle dots, — same sky-blue feathers, same cream belly, same orange beak — launching into the air, its feet just inches above the same thick brown oak branch, wings fully extended 90 degrees, rendered entirely in cartoon style with clean 3px black outlines and dynamic motion lines around its feet. This is frame 7 of a continuous animated sequence.",
