  "prompt": "A tiny round sky-blue songbird with a plump body, soft pale cream-colored belly, darker blue wingtips, a small tuft of feathers on its round head, a tiny pointed orange beak, and large expressive pitch-black oval eyes with two tiny white sparkle dots, — same sky-blue feathers, same cream belly, same orange beak — opening its beak slightly in a small gasp as its eyes soften with hope, looking at the larger bird's wing, same thick brown oak branch, rendered entirely in cartoon style with clean 3px black outlines, minimal gradient fills, and expressive features. This is frame 5 of a continuous animated sequence.",
